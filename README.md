This is a program that contains two frames.

The first frame NumberView has 3 labels (of your choice) and 3 text fields with numbers and
button "update".

The second frame GraphView shows a simple “bar graph” - 3 rectangles next to each other.
Rectangles should have different colors with height proportional to their values in the first
frame.
